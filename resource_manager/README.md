# Resource_Manager

## Purpose
The Resource Manager is meant to provide a solution to the problem of which 
robot does what. However, this is not just applicable to robots specifically, 
but any resources that need to be allocated to perform tasks. There are many 
variations on the problem of resource allocation and its solution, so changes 
and updates are likely as more features and upgrades are added.

As part of this, the Resource Manager tracks what resources are in the system, 
available, and in use and by whom. In other words, it tracks the state of the 
whole system with regards to resources and tasks.

## Functionality
The Resource Manager currently requires a configuration file that specifies what
